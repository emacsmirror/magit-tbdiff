* master (unreleased)

Magit-tbdiff now requires Magit version 4.0.0 or later.

* Version 1.1.1

Adapt ansi-color usage to work with Emacs 28 while retaining
compatibility with older Emacs versions.

* Version 1.1.0

Magit-tbdiff has been updated for the latest version of Magit and now
requires version 3.0.0 or later.

- To be compatible with the latest Magit, ~magit-tbdiff-popup~ has
  been rewritten as a transient command, ~magit-tbdiff~.

  The key bindings for ~--creation-weight~ has changed from ~=w~ to
  ~-w~ because, unlike magit-popup.el, transient.el doesn't require
  that options start with '='.

- The ~magit-tbdiff~ transient now supports range-diff's analogs of
  tbdiff's ~--creation-weight~ and ~--no-patches~: ~creation-factor~
  and ~--no-patch~.

- The ~--dual-color~ switch for ~range-diff~ is now supported.

- The ~--(left|right)-only~ (new in Git 2.31) and ~--no-notes~ (new in
  Git 2.25) switches for ~range-diff~ are now supported but are
  disabled by default.

- New command ~magit-tbdiff-save~ (inspired by ~magit-patch-save~)
  writes the range-diff output to a file.

* Version 0.3.0

- Git v2.19.0 ships with a built-in analog of tbdiff, ~range-diff~!
  The new option ~magit-tbdiff-subcommand~ will be set to "range-diff"
  instead of "tbdiff" if ~git-range-diff~ is detected.

- ~magit-tbdiff-mode~ buffers can now be locked with
  ~magit-toggle-buffer-lock~.
