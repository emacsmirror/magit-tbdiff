Magit-tbdiff NEWS -- history of user-visible changes   -*- mode: org; -*-

* master (unreleased)

Magit-tbdiff has been updated for the latest version of Magit and now
requires version 2.91.0 or later.

- To be compatible with the latest Magit, ~magit-tbdiff-popup~ has
  been rewritten as a transient command, ~magit-tbdiff~.

  The key bindings for ~--creation-weight~ has changed from ~=w~ to
  ~-w~ because, unlike magit-popup.el, transient.el doesn't require
  that options start with '='.

* Version 0.3.0

- Git v2.19.0 ships with a built-in analog of tbdiff, ~range-diff~!
  The new option ~magit-tbdiff-subcommand~ will be set to "range-diff"
  instead of "tbdiff" if ~git-range-diff~ is detected.

- ~magit-tbdiff-mode~ buffers can now be locked with
  ~magit-toggle-buffer-lock~.
